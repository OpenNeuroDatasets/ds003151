There are folders for each participant with their subject number (e.g., “sub-170”). Each participant folder contains one folder each for the hormone-present and hormone-absent phases. Within each phase folder there are 3 folders:
	
1) anat - includes a T1 structural scan.
2) func - all nback-related BOLD scans are included in this folder with event timings indicated in .tsv files. Please see paper for more details.
3) perf - resting state arterial spin labeling scans are included in this folder.
